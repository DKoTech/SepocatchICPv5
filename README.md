## How to install it?

Firstly, you need NGINX to deploy your website related services.
Next, please execute git clone to clone the repository.
Since I have not made any modifications to this version, please make your own changes.
Open VSCode and replace all the words' DKoTechnology 'with the ICP super administrator username you need.
Then open 'src/front/header. html' and modify the comments above, but please keep my name: "DKoTechnology"ã€‚
Clear 'services/data/' and 'services/data_backups'.
Copy the project to the website directory or modify the website directory.
Open the homepage and register your super administrator account.
